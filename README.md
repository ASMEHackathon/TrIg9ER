### Melt Pool Prediction Based on the Process parameter

In our project, we have used the processing parameters in the command line to predict the melt pool charchateristics. 

More specifically, we focus on the prediciton of melt pool size, melt pool size type and melt pool image.

The submission includes: codes, test results, trained model and presentation.
